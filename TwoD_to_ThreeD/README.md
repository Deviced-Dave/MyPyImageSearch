I have used Kaggle notebooks to execute this program. Also, I have tried to run the same code on Google Colab notebooks and they seem to work well.

Pro tip: to make your execution quick, make use of GPUs that these notebook provider give access to.

I have actually enjoyed debugging the code once I got the hang of how it works. Its amazing how a small variable replacement can have a huge impact on the final results. A missed conversion step was also compensated in this code, everything else was kept the same and the results are astonishing. I have modelled in 3D before using Fusion 360 and always thought how a machine learning or an AI algorithm might handle such actions. Well, now we know how! and can see this getting better and better as technology progresses.
