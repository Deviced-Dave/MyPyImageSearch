When you’re working with 3D printing or modeling, converting a 2D image (e.g., a PNG) into a 3D file format such as STL can open up numerous possibilities. From custom designs to practical applications, having the ability to easily convert **images to STL** format is invaluable.

TripoSR is a state-of-the-art open-source model for 3D reconstruction from a single image, collaboratively developed by Tripo AI and Stability AI.

It leverages the principles of Large Reconstruction Model (LRM). 
It is quick and provides good quality of 3D reconstruction using GPU.
It has exhibited superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

The team responsible for creating source code and pretrained models had the goal to empower researchers, developers and creatives to push the boundaries of what's possible in 3D generative AI and 3D content creation.

Default options takes about **6GB VRAM** for a single image input.
