I have used Kaggle generous service to run the .ipynb files above. The reason behind it is that my computer is currently not able to comprehend such computation complexities and thus I had to rely on the GPUs provided by Kaggle.

Another side note: I would recommend to store the pdf I have provided in the folder highlighted in the code or change that string completely based where you've stored it.
